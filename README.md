Might as well turn my hopeless Twitter addiction into something productive...really though, Twitter data is a treasure trove for a scrolling data person. In this repo I'll store random Twitter data projects I work on.

## Accounts I like a lot, literally

- Which accounts have I liked the most tweets from?
- How have my interests changed over time?
- When did the lefty stuff start trickling in? How did they get me?? 

A big thanks to Isabella Vel√°squez for [her guide](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/blog/get-tweet-likes/) on how to get your own Twitter data!
